# YouCompleteMe setup

## Compilation

> cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
> ./install.sh --clang-completer

## YCM configuration generation

To generate YCM configuration use YCM-Generator, for example

> cd /path/to/project
> /path/to/YCM-Generator/config_gen.py -x c -b make .

Please note that the clang package must be available on your system (same version as
for the compilation of YCM has been used!)

If pre-built binaries are used use the "-c" option to state the path to clang/clang++, for example 

> /path/to/YCM-Generator/config_gen.py -x c -b make -c /path/to/clang .

On Ubuntu 16.04, you can get them following

> mkdir -p ~/bin/clang && cd ~/bin/clang
> wget -qO - http://llvm.org/releases/3.9.0/clang+llvm-3.9.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz | tar xJ --strip 1
